# android-pager-animations-demo

A small project that uses PageTransformer and Shared Element Transition to add some cool behaviours to the ordinary ViewPager.

The project also uses [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) (I shamelessly copied the sample data and used it as placeholder data) and [Picasso Transformations](https://github.com/wasabeef/picasso-transformations).
